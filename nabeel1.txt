Autonomous Vehicles for All, All for Autonomous Vehicles: The most efficient solution to Traffic, Carbon Footprint, and Public Safety in the United States Circa the 21st Century

	Imagine your drive to work in the morning is like sitting in a parking lot moving three miles per hour, what about hearing on the news that drunk driving accidents are one of the leading cause of death in the United States, what about hearing the media talk about the end of the world based on the population using fossil fuels which destroy the environment. These are things we see, hear, and talk about every day. In today’s society, cars are the number one form of transportation. With the population size increasing constantly, it makes it very difficult for people to travel without error and for people to be efficient. Autonomous vehicles are already being produced, but are being held back from their full potential because of false accusations and limited support from people and the government. Having government and popular support for the automated vehicle industry will benefit everyone including people who use transportation because it removes the risk of human error and develops a safer community. Consequently, first-time car buyers or drivers looking to trade in their cars should purchase automated vehicles, as they eliminate human error while driving, which reduces accidents, saves lives, reduces traffic, and creates a more sustainable environment. 
	“Cars have been around since the late eighteen hundreds” (Slaby). Over time, cars have developed to become more efficient by driving longer distances with less gas, safer by using technology to create sturdier cars, and eco-friendly by using fewer fossil fuels to power vehicles. Although the cars of today are substantially safer than cars back then, they all have one thing in common; a person must drive. This has not changed, no matter how safe a car is built there is a person in control of the vehicle. Humans make more mistakes as distractions have increased more than ever before. Distractions such as notifications on a cell phone, loud music reducing a person's attention, objects seen on roads, or even the sun shining into the windshield. With these distractions, a high-risk environment is created. The way to solve this issue is to eliminate drivers and replace them with computer programs that communicate with each other to reach a destination. If no one is behind the wheel, then it is highly unlikely the car will get into an accident. This is important as self-driving cars can not be faced with distractions and don't have emotion. In recent years, companies like Tesla have been working to develop a fully autonomous car, and have released numerous semi-autonomous cars. This had a huge impact as they are some of the safest cars made and have an incredibly low crash rate compared to other carmakers. Tesla is also all-electric, which reduces carbon footprint, helping the environment. Self-driving cars can eliminate traffic and make the world a more efficient place. 
	With people behind the wheel, accidents are inevitable due to human error being so common. Car accidents have “injured almost five million people and caused forty thousand fatalities if people didn’t drive as much, these accidents would decrease dramatically” (Achenbach). The average person gets inside of a moving vehicle that is operated by a human at least once a day. This means that there is a probability of the person dying in a crash, “considering deaths in the U.S. totaled slightly less than 2.6 million per year, the individual American driver’s odds of dying as a result of an injury sustained in an automobile crash come out to about 1 in 77 — making it one of the highest-probability causes of death”(Riegler). Transportation is a necessity for most people; those getting to work, school, home, and etc. Behind almost all vehicles there is a human operator. This could be dangerous as drivers must rely on themselves and other drivers to not make a mistake and cause an accident. Human beings are not perfect, all humans are easily distracted. With it being so simple to get distracted, it makes it almost as simple to cause an accident injuring others or even causing death. The main solution to this issue is to eliminate the driver itself. Human error is the leading cause of road accidents as with modern technology, crashing due to a mechanical error is very rare, “about 94 percent of car accidents are caused by drivers, only about one percent are caused by vehicle errors” (Coeckelbergh). If all human drivers were replaced by computer programs and fully autonomous vehicles, the statistics on injuries and fatalities would decrease dramatically. This is because a car is a “machine power of which far exceeds the powers of humans” (Coeckelbergh). As of now, many people do not support fully autonomous vehicles because of false rumors, governments also don't fully support the idea because it would heavily cut funding from profits from gas and fossil fuels. Autonomous vehicles will communicate with each other based on satellite technologies which prevent them from crashing into one another. This makes the cars more reliable as they do not have to depend on human input and can function alone. With support from governments and people cities in the United States can be much safer and efficient on the roads filled with millions of cars. 
	In addition to distracted driving, another challenge drivers face behind the wheel is dangerous weather conditions in different parts of the United States. If the weather is bad it increases the risk for an accident, a chance of human error is higher as distractions increase. In the pouring rain, roads are less visible due to water on the windshield, and slippery roads. This also applies to snow as tires can slide on snow. In heavy wind, cars turn easier and are harder to control. In beaming sunlight visibility is reduced as it becomes difficult for the eye to process certain obstacles. In foggy weather, visibility is reduced as well, because it becomes harder to see a farther distance, limiting driving capability. With a human driver in the driver's seat, all of these conditions can and do cause major car accidents and end in fatality. Conversely, self-driving cars do not rely on cameras to see objects, but they rely on motion detectors to scan a three-dimensional figure, to process direction. This means that weather conditions do not present visibility challenges to an autonomous vehicle in the way they might to a human driver, preventing accidents caused by people. The autonomous vehicles will also be programmed to drive safely to prevent loss of traction on slippery and wet roads. This will help as people drive differently in the rain and snow, but with a programmed algorithm to maximize safety, accidents in these weather conditions would be prevented.
	Perhaps one of the strongest arguments for autonomous cars is that a fully autonomous society would save millions of people billions of dollars every year. Not only from preventing accidents, but from insurance. As cars advance and safety features become more reliable, the need for high insurance decreases. With a fully autonomous society, the need for insurance is not valid. This is because a new transportation system with technology-based traffic control will prevent accidents from happening. Car insurance companies will resort to ensuring driver care for mechanical issues of new cars such as worn tires, and old parts. Car insurance will not be eliminated, but the need will decrease. This is good for the population as it saves money, but companies will be forced to use different ideas to produce income. Technology changes over time, and companies must adapt to this. Although a fully autonomous society won’t be in effect for a while, companies should be prepared.
	Colleges in the United States are expensive for the average person, putting millions of 
people in billions of debt. Car insurance decreases in price as people age, this means the younger the person, the more expensive the insurance costs. Most young drivers are reckless as they crave adrenaline while driving. Due to young drivers being more prone to cashing, insurance costs more. As drivers get older and gain experience, driving becomes more natural. This reduces insurance costs. When young adults start their life after high school, there are many expenses. Students have to pay thousands for a strong education, and necessities. Insurance adds on to this and increases financial stress among students. With a fully-autonomous society that does not require insurance based on the driving experience, students around the United States save millions of dollars.
One critique of the autonomous car industry is because it cuts jobs and eliminates insurance needs, it creates different jobs in other areas. The demand for engineers and factory workers to develop and create these vehicles will increase. As times change, the need for different jobs changes. In the last century, workers for farms were a necessity, but now with machines taking over, workers are not needed. A decrease in jobs should not be a reason for governments to take action in producing an autonomous society as new jobs and fields are created compensating for the loss in other areas. Another area of jobs that will decrease is drivers. The need for Uber, Postmates and truck drivers will decrease dramatically. This may not seem fair, but it increases the safety of people which is more important. Jobs come and go, but the safety of humans should always be valued more.
	Yet another reservation some might have with the autonomous car is that if one enjoys driving, they can not drive anymore. The idea of a complete self-driving community is very much into the far future. People will be driving vehicles for many more years and even decades. Today, self-driving vehicles are only a fraction of the market but are increasing every year. With time, technology advances. This will change the human perception of autonomous vehicles as the safety of the community comes before enjoyment. People will still be driving for many years, but there will be more autonomous vehicles on the roads making travel safer and more efficient. 
	With millions of cars on the road and the need for more vehicles rising, traffic all over the United States is getting worse year by year, making it more important than ever to have a mode of transportation that is as safe as it is useful. Traffic is caused by “the people who work, go to school, and even run errands during about the same hours so they can interact with each other” (Millar). This is becoming a huge issue in today's society because it causes people to rush and get frustrated. This ultimately leads to road rage and causes accidents. With autonomous vehicles
all cars would be in sync at once, this would help with traffic digestion as cars would be traveling at the same speed. Self-driving vehicles have many benefits as they will help get people to their destination on time, prevent road rage, and avoid safety concerns. Traffic congestion, which is an absolutely essential mechanism for American regions due to population size” (Millar). With rush hour as everyone travels to a destination in the same direction, congestion is inevitable. Although autonomous vehicles will not reduce congestion, the vehicles will increase speed and traffic control. When one car slows down, the cars behind slow down as well. This causes an effect that will last for miles. Traveling the same speed in all lanes will create a synchronized wave helping people reach their destination more efficiently. This will also help 
“drivers who had been using alternative routes” to reach a destination (Miller). The best way to reduce major problems of traffic across the United States is for the approval and call to action by governments to implement self-driving vehicles into daily life.
	Most cars on the streets in the United States are powered by gasoline, gasoline uses fossil fuels and releases carbon dioxide into the air we breathe. This is heavily damaging to the ozone layer in the atmosphere. “Motor vehicles collectively cause 75 percent of carbon monoxide pollution in the U.S (Riegler). Although the government and auto-companies have been producing more eco-friendly cars that are efficient, the demand for vehicles is rising and causing consumers to purchase more vehicles. This adds to carbon emissions and damages the environment. At this rate, the air we breathe is getting more polluted day by day. Conversely, autonomous vehicles are an excellent solution because of the higher standards with regard to their emissions. Autonomous vehicles are required to be electric as the transmission system in gas-powered vehicles can be operated from a computer. Companies like Tesla are ahead of the game by developing semi-autonomous vehicles that are electric. Consequently, if the US government offered incentives to first-time autonomous vehicle buyers, this would have a positive effect on decreasing the number of vehicles on the road polluting the air, helping the environmental state of America. Global affairs would calm as America produces tons of carbon emissions polluting the air. With autonomous vehicles, carbon emissions would be dramatically reduced, saving the environment and creating a better name for the United States as a country. With many benefits helping people, government reputation, and the environment, first-time buyers and those interested in upgrading their vehicles should strongly consider purchasing an autonomous vehicle. The national government should incentivize this by making self-driving cars a mandatory effort that needs to be put in place before the gas-powered cars cause more damage. 
	The pollution caused by carbon emissions is only getting worse.”There were 15% more days with unhealthy air in America both last year and the year before than there were on average from 2013 through 2016, the four years when America had its fewest number of those days since at least 1980” (Stilgoe). This is harming humans as air quality decreases. With the melting of the polar ice caps, to the rise of animal extinction. This is because “breathing becomes more difficult as carbon dioxide levels rise” (Stilgoe). Humans need oxygen to survive, as cars are the leading cause of producing harmful emissions into the air, meaning now is a perfect time for a nationwide transition to autonomous vehicles. Not only the human population, but environmental harm is also happening. The pollution in the air along with the burning and cutting down trees is an equation for disaster. There is more harm in the air and less oxygen being created. The journey to cleaner vehicles is a slow process, autonomous vehicles are one of the first and simplest steps in the process. This is because clean air/hybrid vehicles travel farther while using less gasoline, helping vehicles travel longer distances while using less gasoline. This is not effective as there are many more vehicles that produce carbon emissions such as; semi-trucks, mail delivery vehicles, and official government vehicles. It is not an overnight process, but the United States must not give in to lobbying from automotive companies and start developing stricter rules on vehicles to maintain a healthier more sustainable environment.
	Ultimately, despite the drawbacks of the original high cost to ownership, autonomous vehicles are less costly for US society as a whole--they make travel safer, cost less in terms of upkeep and insurance, and ensure cleaner air. Consequently, buyers should strongly consider purchasing an autonomous vehicle as their first vehicle when shopping for a first vehicle or a replacement vehicle. Governments can further encourage this by showing that a completely autonomous society will help the United States become a more efficient country. With complete self-driving vehicles, traffic would reduce tremendously making travel much faster, accidents would be reduced completely making travel safer, gas vehicles would be replaced by electric vehicles making the United States more eco-friendly. By eliminating human dependence to drive vehicles the risk of crashes and human error is completely reduced cutting down insurance costs. This is a key solution to many issues as driving in the United States is the most used transportation system and citizens and residents depend on it. Since transportation is so important, it is helpful to make it efficient, safe, and eco-friendly. With government help and support from citizens, this goal can be accomplished, helping millions of people in the United States. Autonomous vehicles are the key to a better society as a whole.
